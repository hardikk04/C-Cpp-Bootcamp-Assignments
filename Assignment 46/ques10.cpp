/* 10. Given a positive integer N, the task is to check whether N can be represented as the
difference between two positive perfect cubes or not. If found to be true, then print
“Yes”. Otherwise, print “No” using a map.
Example:
Input: N = 124
Output: Yes
Explanation: Since 124 can be represented as (125 – 1) = (53 – 13). Therefore, print
Yes. */
