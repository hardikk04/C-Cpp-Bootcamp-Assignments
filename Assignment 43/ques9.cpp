/* 9. Given three arrays X[], Y[], and Z[] each consisting of N integers, the task is to find
the maximum number of triplets (X[i], Y[i], Z[i]) such that (X[i] < Y[i] < Z[i]) for any
permutation of the three arrays using priority_queue
Input: X = {9, 6, 14, 1, 8}, Y = {2, 10, 3, 12, 11}, Z = {15, 13, 5, 7, 4}
Output: 3
Explanation:
After rearranging the arrays X[], Y[] and Z[] as {1, 6, 8, 9, 14}, {3, 2, 10, 12, 11}, and
{4, 7, 15, 13, 5} respectively. The increasing triplets are {1, 3, 4}, {8, 10, 15} and {9,
12, 13}.
Therefore, the total count of such triplets is 3. */
