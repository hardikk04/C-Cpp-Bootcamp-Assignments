/* 10. Given an array arr[] of size N and a number K, the task is to find the length of the
smallest subsequence such that the sum of the subsequence is greater than or equal
to number K do it using priority_queue.
Example:
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9, 14, 10, 2, 5}, K = 35
Output: 4
Smallest subsequence with the sum greater than or equal to the given sum K is {7, 9,
14, 10}
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 7, 6, 5, 12}, K = 70
Output:-1
Subsequence with sum greater than equal to the given sum is not possible. */
